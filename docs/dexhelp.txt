Note: commands are case sensitive
II. Mounting ATA / ATAPI drives==============================================

In order to mount IDE drives, first dtermine the name assigned to 
the partition you wish to mount (dex-os supports FAT16/FAT32) using
the lsdev command.

Then use the mount command:
mount fat <name of partition> <desired mount point>

For CD-ROM drives, chage fat to cdfs like this:
mount cdfs <name of partition> < desired mount point>

III. Changing keyboard set

There is a possibility that the current scancode set is not working properly
for your keyboard. In that case, you can use the ff commands:

$keyb -useset n (where n=(1-3) is the desired scancode set)

You can place it as an entry in the autoexec.bat so that it
automaically configues the keyboard on startup.
